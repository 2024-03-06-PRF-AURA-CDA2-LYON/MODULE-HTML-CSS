      Zidane started his career at Cannes, before establishing himself as one of
      the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to
      Italian team Juventus, where he won several trophies, including two Serie
      A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of
      €77.5 million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight years.
      In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the
      UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League final, he scored a
      left-foot volleyed winner that is considered one of the greatest goals in
      the competition's history.
