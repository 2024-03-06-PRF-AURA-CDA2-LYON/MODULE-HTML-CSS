      Zinedine Yazid Zidane (French: Zinédine Yazid Zidane;[4] Kabyle: Zineddin
      Lyazid Zidan; born 23 June 1972), popularly known as Zizou, is a French
      professional football manager and former player who played as an attacking
      midfielder. He most recently coached Spanish club Real Madrid and is one
      of the most successful coaches in the world. Widely regarded as one of the
      greatest players of all time, Zidane was a playmaker renowned for his
      elegance, vision, passing, ball control, and technique. He received many
      individual accolades as a player, including being named FIFA World Player
      of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and winning the 1998 Ballon d'Or.
      Zidane started his career at Cannes, before establishing himself as one of
      the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to
      Italian team Juventus, where he won several trophies, including two Serie
      A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of
      €77.5 million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight years.
      In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the
      UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League final, he scored a
      left-foot volleyed winner that is considered one of the greatest goals in
      the competition's history.
