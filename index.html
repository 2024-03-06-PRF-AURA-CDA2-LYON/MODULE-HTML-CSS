        The 2002 FIFA World Cup, also branded as Korea Japan 2002, was the 17th
        FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial football world championship for men's
        national teams organized by FIFA. It was held from 31 May to 30 June
        2002 at sites in South Korea and Japan, with its final match hosted by
        Japan at International Stadium in Yokohama. During the opening ceremony,
        the championship was declared opened by President of South Korea Kim
        Dae-jung.[1] A field of 32 teams qualified for this World Cup, which was
        the first to be held in Asia, the first to be held outside of the
        Americas or Europe, as well as the first to be jointly hosted by more
        than one nation. China, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their World
        Cup debuts, with Senegal being the only debutant to qualify the group
        stages and make it to the quarterfinals. The tournament had several
        upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions
        France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point
        without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being
        eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the
        semi-finals, beating Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They
        became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF
        regions and one of the first Asian teams (along with Turkey in this
        World Cup) to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup. However, the most
        potent team at the tournament, Brazil, prevailed, winning the final
        against Germany 2–0, making them the first and only country to have won
        the World Cup five times.[2] The victory qualified Brazil for the 2003
        and subsequently 2005 FIFA Confederations Cups, its fourth and fifth
        Confederations Cup appearance in a row. In the third place play-off
        match against South Korea, Turkey won 3–2, taking third place in only
        their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the
        FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).[3] The 2002 World
        Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one
        to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to
        the present, a ball with the same technical specifications but different
        colors has been used in the final. South Korea and Japan were selected
        as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and
        Mexico presented three rival bids. South Korea's entry into the race was
        seen by some as a response to the bid of political and sporting rival
        Japan.[4] FIFA leaders were split on whom to favor as host as politics
        within the world governing body held sway.[5] With Mexico regarded as a
        long shot, the battle to host the tournament came down to South Korea
        and Japan. The two Asian rivals went on a massive and expensive PR blitz
        around the world, prompting Sultan Ahmad Shah, the head of the Asian
        Football Confederation, to step in.[4] FIFA boss João Havelange had long
        backed the Japanese bid,[5] but his rival in FIFA, UEFA chief Lennart
        Johansson, sought to undermine Havelange's plans.[5] UEFA and the AFC
        viewed co-hosting between the two Asian rivals as the best option.[5]
        South Korea and Japan were finally faced with a choice of having no
        World Cup or a shared World Cup and they reluctantly chose to go along
        with co-hosting.[5] South Korea and Japan were chosen unanimously as
        co-hosts in preference to Mexico.[6] This was the first World Cup to be
        hosted by more than one country, the second being the 2026 World Cup,
        which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This is
        also the first ever World Cup to be hosted in Asia, the other being the
        2022 World Cup, hosted by Qatar, twenty years later. The general
        secretary of South Korea's bidding committee, Song Young-shik, stated
        that FIFA was interested in staging some matches in North Korea in order
        to aid Korean reunification, but it was ruled out.[7] At the time the
        decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals
        (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998
        competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup
        without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in
        1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so
        there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions
        from 1928). The unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans
        in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their
        time zone.[8] With games taking place in the European morning, some
        schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up
        communal watching events before the start of work.
